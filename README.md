<!-- git/github -->

## Install Git

The team will use Git for [version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).

- Download the git executable from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
- Run the executable and follow the prompts to install Git. Default selections will be okay for now.
- [Extra Resource] [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmbAn2_5uGs) tutorial walks through the process.

<!-- vscode -->

## Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Members can use any editor of their choice to write code. We recommend VSCode because it is extensible and has many features which make it great for writing and maintaining software.

- Follow the steps in the Installation section of [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows#_installation) to install VSCode for windows.

<!-- some vscode extensions for JavaScript development? -->

<!-- nvm/nodejs -->

## Install node.js and npm using nvm

Programming in JavaScript usually requires node.js to be installed.

NPM (node package manager) is a package manager for node.js packages/applications.

We can use NVM (node version manager) to manage different installed versions of node.js, which means you can jump on other projects which may use different node.js versions easily.
